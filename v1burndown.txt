Make it so you can choose a projection in df/f mode [medium]
Line chart minimum height option [low]

REFACTOR PUSH   
    BIG CLEANUP IN ROIVERT.CPP
        - mostly done, a few methods that could be pimpl'd
        - could follow the pattern in ROIVert.cpp to make things more memory safe, more organized.
        - would sortof like to reCaps Roivert to ROIVert
        
    Static analysis, hunt for messes, hunt for consts
    Cleanup folder
    
Remaining Tidy pushes:
    instrument debugger?
    more tooltips
    todos, comments, etc.
        make default chart window undocked

    KNOWN ISSUES LIST?
        - CLICKING WHEN VERY ZOOMED IN CAN SELECT ROIS BY CLICKING A PIXEL OR TWO OUTSIDE OF THEM
        - ARTIFACTS ON THE EDGE OF THE IMAGE IF SELECTION HANDLE GOES OUTSIDE OF THE IMAGE, SHOULD DISAPPEAR ON MOUSEUP
        - occasionally may see a 1E-04 in place of a zero in a line chart?
        - no progress bar with multipage, and downsampling time doesn't improve load speed, but load speed is WAYYY faster
    
---
when this is all done i really want to implify and simplify roivert, and make everything smartptr
quick look at export video
What does this look like if i try to build in gnu or something...on linux? How about port to Qt and use vs, with assumption that this would make it easier to build on mac? didn't I have something like this once before?
