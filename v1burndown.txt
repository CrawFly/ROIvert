Line chart minimum height option
Tiff multipage detection and load
Make it so you can choose a projection in df/f mode



REFACTOR PUSH   
    BIG CLEANUP IN ROIVERT.CPP
        - make sure all NEWs are Qt managed, ugh
        
    honestly could consider moving a lot of the qt junk into object scope
        ...
        
        
    Static analysis, hunt for messes, hunt for consts
    Cleanup folder
    
Remaining Tidy pushes:
    instrument debugger?
    more tooltips
    todos, comments, etc.
        make default chart window undocked
        

    
RELEASE PUSH
    [] fresh vm
    [] git repo cleanup
    [] license
    [] install files
    
DOC:
    [] release notes
    [] videos
    [] html
    
    
    KNOWN ISSUES LIST?
        - CLICKING WHEN VERY ZOOMED IN CAN SELECT ROIS BY CLICKING A PIXEL OR TWO OUTSIDE OF THEM
        - ARTIFACTS ON THE EDGE OF THE IMAGE IF SELECTION HANDLE GOES OUTSIDE OF THE IMAGE, SHOULD DISAPPEAR ON MOUSEUP
        - occasionally may see a 1E-04 in place of a zero in a line chart?

when this is all done i really want to implify and simplify roivert, and make everything smartptr
quick look at export video
What does this look like if i try to build in gnu or something...on linux? How about port to Qt and use vs, with assumption that this would make it easier to build on mac? didn't I have something like this once before?
