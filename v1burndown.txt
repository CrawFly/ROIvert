Consider (for toolwindow refactor:
    could the abstraction include the dockwindow? Does anything have to change?
        Two solutions here:
            1. the tool isa dockwindow, and it contains the widget
            2. the tool isa widget and it spawns a parent...awkward...any advantage?
            

Move palette to file
 Consider a button to automatically use palette for all rois, particularly if i end up with multiple
 Organize other resources, I have icons is there anything else?
 
Line chart minimum height option

convenience black/white buttons for RGB widget

REFACTOR PUSH   
    BIG CLEANUP IN ROIVERT.CPP
        - make sure all NEWs are Qt managed, ugh
       
    Cleanup [] toolwindows, and bring into the fold
        
    Static analysis, hunt for messes, hunt for consts
    Cleanup folder
    
Remaining Tidy pushes:
    instrument debugger?
    more tooltips
    todos, comments, etc.
        make default chart window undocked

    KNOWN ISSUES LIST?
        - CLICKING WHEN VERY ZOOMED IN CAN SELECT ROIS BY CLICKING A PIXEL OR TWO OUTSIDE OF THEM
        - ARTIFACTS ON THE EDGE OF THE IMAGE IF SELECTION HANDLE GOES OUTSIDE OF THE IMAGE, SHOULD DISAPPEAR ON MOUSEUP
        - occasionally may see a 1E-04 in place of a zero in a line chart?
        
    
---
when this is all done i really want to implify and simplify roivert, and make everything smartptr
quick look at export video
What does this look like if i try to build in gnu or something...on linux? How about port to Qt and use vs, with assumption that this would make it easier to build on mac? didn't I have something like this once before?
