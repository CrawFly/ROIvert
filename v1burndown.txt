    KNOWN ISSUES LIST?
        - CLICKING WHEN VERY ZOOMED IN CAN SELECT ROIS BY CLICKING A PIXEL OR TWO OUTSIDE OF THEM
        - ARTIFACTS ON THE EDGE OF THE IMAGE IF SELECTION HANDLE GOES OUTSIDE OF THE IMAGE, SHOULD DISAPPEAR ON MOUSEUP
        - occasionally may see a 1E-04 in place of a zero in a line chart?

when this is all done i really want to implify and simplify roivert, and make everything smartptr
quick look at export video
What does this look like if i try to build in gnu or something...on linux? How about port to Qt and use vs, with assumption that this would make it easier to build on mac? didn't I have something like this once before?
